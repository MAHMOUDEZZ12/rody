    content: `Feeling sluggish or looking to tone your physique? Two of our most effective body treatments, Maderotherapy and Lymphatic Drainage, can help, but they work in different ways. Understanding the difference is key to achieving your wellness goals.\n\n**Maderotherapy (Wood Therapy):**\nThis is a deep, sculpting massage that uses specially designed wooden tools to break down fat deposits and cellulite. It’s an intensive treatment ideal for contouring the body, defining curves, and improving skin texture. Think of it as a natural, non-invasive body sculpting session.\n\n**Lymphatic Drainage:**\nThis is a much gentler massage focused on stimulating your lymphatic system—the body's natural detox pathway. It helps reduce water retention, eliminate toxins, and decrease bloating. It’s perfect for post-surgery recovery, reducing puffiness, or simply giving your immune system a boost.\n\n**Which is for you?**\n\n- Choose **Maderotherapy** for body contouring and cellulite reduction.\n- Choose **Lymphatic Drainage** for detoxification, de-bloating, and a gentle wellness boost.\n\nReady to sculpt or detoxify? Our therapists at Rody Luxury Spa are ready to help. Book your preferred treatment today!`,
