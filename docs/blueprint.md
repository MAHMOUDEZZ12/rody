## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#D4AF37), evoking luxury and wellness.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#1A1A1A), to make the gold 'pop' and provide a sleek, high-end feel. It has very low saturation.
- Accent color: Bronze (#CD7F32) - an analogous color to gold but darker and slightly less saturated - used for secondary actions and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif with a high-end feel. Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif with a modern feel.
- Use elegant, minimalist icons that represent wellness and luxury, with a subtle gold gradient.
- Clean, spacious layout with clear sections for services, bookings, and user profiles, with high-quality photography to create a sense of premium service.
- Subtle, sophisticated transitions and animations to enhance user experience, without being distracting. A gentle fade-in effect is appropriate for page transitions.
